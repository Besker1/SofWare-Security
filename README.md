## 1. Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements.
Artemis Financial, a financial consulting company, sought to modernize their operations by enhancing software security, particularly by integrating a file verification step into their web application to secure client data and financial transactions.

## 2. What did you do very well when you found your clientâ€™s software security vulnerabilities?
I excelled in identifying and addressing vulnerabilities swiftly, implementing robust encryption for data integrity and secure communication protocols. Secure coding is crucial as it protects the company from data breaches and builds trust among clients.

## 3. What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
The most challenging yet helpful part was applying the vulnerability assessment process to identify real and potential security issues, which enabled a focused approach to mitigation.

## 4. How did you increase layers of security?
I increased security layers by introducing SHA-256 for checksum verifications and configuring HTTPS to ensure secure data transmission. For future assessments, I would utilize comprehensive tools like OWASP Dependency Check to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.

## 5. How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure?
After refactoring, I conducted thorough testing including static analysis and functional testing to ensure no new vulnerabilities were introduced, ensuring the code's functionality and security.

## 6. What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
I utilized Spring Boot for secure application development, OWASP for vulnerability checking, and standard encryption libraries which will be beneficial for securing future software developments.

## 7. Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
I would demonstrate the refactored secure application code, the process documentation, and the vulnerability assessment results to showcase my proficiency in secure software development and problem-solving skills.
